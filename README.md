# ai_game
A web application game, that uses a basic A.I. system to challenge the user in choosing points on a grid. 

There will be a timer that will begin slow and tell the user when to tap an area, the time will gradually get faster and faster.

The user will have 10 hp that will decrease when the A.I. guesses right.

# Concept
The A.I. will attempt to guess the next spot, and the user gains a point for every point chosen that the AI does not guess.
# Frameworks
This project incorporates the Phaser javascript game library, JQUERY, Bootstrap, and Angular.
The majority of the project will be coded in Javascript.
