# AI_game
A proof-of-concept web application game, that uses a basic A.I. system to challenge the user in choosing points on a grid. 

There will be a timer that will begin slowly and gradually pick up speed. A prompt will tell the user when to tap an area for each interval.

The user will have 10 health points that will decrease whenever the A.I. guesses right.

# Concept
The A.I. will attempt to guess the next spot, and the user gains a point for every point chosen that the AI does not guess.
The A.I. will gather data each round for every game and build a database of previous patterns.

# Frameworks
This project will be coded primarily in Python, with front end libraries such as Bootstrap for presentation.
